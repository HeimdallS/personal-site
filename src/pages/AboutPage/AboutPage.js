                After working in sales for the majority of my professional life, I consider myself 
                an expert in communication and relationship management. However, I have always prided 
                myself as being a life-long learner in pursuit of continued personal growth and 
                development. My motive in switching career paths from Sales to Web Development is to 
                immerse myself in a constantly evolving industry; one that will allow me to utilize my 
                communication skills to work in collaborative environments while also pushing me to 
                challenge myself and continue to hone my programming skills and abilities.
